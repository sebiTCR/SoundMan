<h1 align="center"> Soundman </h1>
<p align="center"> Let's <b> <i>simplify</i> </b> the way you use audio! </p>
</br>

# Objective
If you're tired of creating <i>Audio Nodes</i> for everything in Godot 4, <b>Soundman</b> might be the right solution for you. Instead, you can register all of your sounds in one place and play them with a single line of code: 

<p align="center">SoundManager.play(<b>"your sound"</b>) </p>

# Current Status
Currently, you can only **register and play** sounds. Aditionally, you can also create buttons that play sounds when clicked. While the project is still in ***Alpha***, expect major changes in the future.

## Future objectives
- [ ] Manage buses and volumes
- [ ] Sound Categories
- [ ] Spatial audio management
- [ ] More UI components that play sounds

# Demo
This repository contains both the **addon** and an **example scene** that makes use of the sound manager.
[You can test the demo in the browser too!](https://sebitcr.itch.io/soundman-demo)
